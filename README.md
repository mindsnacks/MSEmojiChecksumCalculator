## Why?

Checksums are a useful way to quickly check the contents of a bunch of data. The MD5 checksum spits out 16 bytes of essentially random data. While this is great for computers, humans don't want to look at a huge hex string. The emoji checksum calculator spits out 4 emoji character hash.

The caclulator uses 845 different emoji characters for a total of 509,831,700,625 unique hash codes. Good enough.
